We conduct toxicity analysis on wikipedia comments using Wikipedia Toxic Comments Data Set from Kaggle.
The data is segregated into 5 toxicity categories: toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult and identity_hate.
We achieve a average ROC-AUC score of 98.1% across all categories using a Random Forest Model with TF-IDF vectors.
